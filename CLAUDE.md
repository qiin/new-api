# CLAUDE.md — Project Conventions for new-api

## MANDATORY: Read AGENTS.md with the Read tool

Do not treat `@AGENTS.md` as loaded. Claude Code does not reliably inline that import.

Before any planning, coding, reviewing, or answering a project question, you MUST call the Read tool on the repo-root file `AGENTS.md` and wait for the full contents. This is the first action of every session and every new task.

Rules:

- Do not start from memory, summaries, or this file alone.
- Do not skip the Read because a previous turn mentioned AGENTS.md.
- Do not replace the Read with a grep, glob, or partial skim.
- After reading, follow every rule in `AGENTS.md` for the rest of the work.
- If the task touches `web/`, also Read `web/AGENTS.md` before editing frontend files.
- If the task touches billing as defined under **Billing rules (mandatory read gate)** in `AGENTS.md`, also Read `.agents/rules/billing.md` in full before planning or editing. Tasks outside that definition may skip it.
- 本仓库是上游 new-api 的 fork：任何改动上游代码的任务，必须先 Read `.agents/rules/fork-changes.md` 并遵守其中的变更记录与上游兼容规则。
